# ðŸ’– Love Calculator (Python)

This is a fun and simple Python program that calculates a "love score" based on the names of two people. The project uses basic string manipulation, input/output, and conditional logic.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter two names.
2. The program counts the occurrences of the letters in the words **TRUE** and **LOVE** in the combined names.
3. It calculates a love score by combining the counts.
4. Based on the score, a fun message is displayed.

## âœ¨ Example

```
Welcome to Love Calculator!
What is your name?
> Alice
What is your partner's name?
> Bob
Your score is 42, you are alright together.
```
