# 🃏 Blackjack Game (Python)

This is a simple terminal-based Blackjack game written in Python. It's a project that helps understand conditional logic, functions, and user interaction in a CLI environment.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Run the game in a terminal or IDE that supports input/output.
- The player and computer are each dealt cards.
- The player decides whether to draw more cards or hold.
- The computer draws cards until its score is above 17.
- The closest score to 21 (without going over) wins!

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically detects a Blackjack on the first draw.
- Simple opponent logic for the computer.
