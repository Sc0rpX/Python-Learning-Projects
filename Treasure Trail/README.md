# 🗺️ Treasure Trail - A Text Adventure Game

**Treasure Trail** is an interactive text-based adventure game written in Python. The player embarks on a mysterious journey through a forest in search of hidden treasure, making choices along the way that lead to victory... or doom.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- The player wakes up in a mysterious forest and must choose paths, cross rivers, explore caves, and make life-or-death decisions.
- The outcome depends on the player's choices — choose wisely to reach the treasure!

## 🧠 What I learned

- Conditional logic (`if` / `elif` / `else`)
- Working with `input()` and basic string handling
- Creating interactive command-line experiences

## 🛠️ How to Play

Read the prompts and type your decisions when asked. The story will change based on your input.

## ✨ Example
